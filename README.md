# Reset CSS 

A modern reset stylesheet designed for student learning, accessibility, and real-world web development.

## 🎯 What is This?

This `reset.css` file is part of the UCBA Stylekit — a lightweight, educational CSS toolkit designed for students learning modern HTML and CSS. It builds on the foundation of [Eric Meyer's Reset v2.0](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) and includes modern enhancements for accessibility, responsive design, and clarity.

This reset stylesheet:

- Normalizes default styles across browsers
- Provides a consistent baseline for margin, padding, and typography
- Adds accessibility features (focus outlines, `prefers-reduced-motion`)
- Includes useful resets for media, form elements, HTML5 tags, and print
- Is heavily commented to support learning and comprehension

## 💡 Why Use It?

Different browsers apply their own default styles to elements like headings, lists, and forms. These inconsistencies can cause frustration for beginners and professionals alike. This reset:

- Gives your projects a consistent starting point
- Removes unpredictable browser spacing and typography quirks
- Encourages clean, accessible markup and styling habits
- Helps students focus on *what they build*, not how browsers render it by default

## 📚 How to Use

1. **Add the CSS file to your project.**  
   Download `reset.css` or copy it into your project directory.

2. **Link it in your HTML `<head>`**:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="reset.css">
   ```

3. **Place your custom styles AFTER the reset:**<br>
This ensures your styles build on top of a clean foundation.
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="reset.css">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
   ```

4. **Use it for every project you build in my courses**<br>
It's especially helpful for layout, typography, accessibility, and consistency!


## 🔧 What It Covers

- Universal margin, padding, and border reset

- Normalized font styles, line height, and heading behavior

- Form field consistency across browsers

- Table and caption formatting

- Semantic element support (e.g., `<section>`, `<figure>`, `<details>`)

- Print styles for better output in PDFs and printed pages

- Accessibility-minded features like visible :focus outlines

- Utility class: `.img-block` for image layout control


## 🧠 Conventions Used

- **Font Inheritance**: All elements inherit the font from the body  

- **Box Sizing**: Uses `box-sizing: border-box` for layout sanity  

- **Line Height**: Slightly increased for better readability (`line-height: 1.3`)  

- **Commenting**: Clear, sectioned comments guide students through the logic  

- **Accessibility**: Includes visible focus indicators and media query for reduced motion  

- **Browser Support**: Supports modern browsers while cleaning up quirks from older ones
